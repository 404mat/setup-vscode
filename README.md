# vscode-setup : Settings for Visual Studio Code

These are my personnal favorite settings and extensions that I apply on every machine (home or work) for the Visual Studio Code IDE.
Older major versions of these settings can be found in the `archive` folder at the root of the project, or by browsing old commits. They will get updated as my taste changes over the time ðŸ˜„

## Fonts

Font of choice for editor and terminal : [Anonymous Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anonymous+Pro)

2nd font of choice : [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/lp/mono/)

## Settings

The [settings file](./vscode-settings.json) can be copied as is. Some settings require a few extensions to be installed in VSCode. You can find them in the **Extensions** section below.

## Themes

I mainly use my own theme that you can find here : [MossFrame](https://github.com/404mat/mossframe)

Other theme I made : [404 Muted](https://github.com/404mat/404muted).

## Extensions

Som extensions are specific to languages and my personnal use. The other ones are mainly for developer experience (animations, colors, ease of use, ...).
